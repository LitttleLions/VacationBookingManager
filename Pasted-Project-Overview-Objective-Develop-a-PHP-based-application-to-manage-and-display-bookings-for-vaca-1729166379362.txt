Project Overview

Objective:
Develop a PHP-based application to manage and display bookings for vacation rentals. The application will retrieve data through the Smoobu API and provide various views and functionalities to efficiently manage bookings.

Technology Stack:

    Server: PHP 7
    Database: None (direct API usage)
    Frontend: HTML, CSS (with a focus on modern and appealing design)
    Additional Requirements: Multilingual support (starting with German and English)

API Integration

API Provider: Smoobu
Documentation: Smoobu API Documentation

API Credentials:

    SettingsChannelId: 1115695
    APIKey: 9V1lV6cSqy8EbeOV1v4cXIIuIgNl41Pz

    Security Note: Ensure that API keys are stored securely on the server and are not publicly accessible. Never share API keys in public forums or with unauthorized individuals.
