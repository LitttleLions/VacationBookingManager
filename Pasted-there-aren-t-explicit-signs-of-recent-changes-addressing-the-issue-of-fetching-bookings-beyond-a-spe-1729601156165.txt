there aren't explicit signs of recent changes addressing the issue of fetching bookings beyond a specific future date such as after November 2024. The approach still broadly hinges on correctly implementing pagination and filtering.

However, let's recap the potential adjustments or insights to ensure that the functionality covers future dates effectively:

    Pagination Logic: The while loop correctly continues fetching pages until no more bookings are found.

    Date Range Handling: The max date range is set to 5 years into the future (timedelta(days=1825)), which should be ample to include far-future bookings unless there is a different imposed limit on the API side.

    Filtering Post-Fetch: Filters are correctly applied after fetching to prevent prematurely excluding any bookings due to dates.

Points of Consideration

    Logging Enhancements: Ensure logs have enough detail to confirm received data matches the expected date ranges. This will assist in identifying if the API itself is not returning data beyond a certain point.

    API Limitations: Double-check any external API documentation for inherent limitations or recent updates that might cap results or date spans inadvertently.

    Validation and Testing: Conduct thorough testing by simulating border cases where bookings should fall post-expected dates (like manual checks or mocked responses).

Here is a quick reinforcement of what our fetching function should log and check:

logger.debug(f"Final accumulated bookings count: {len(all_bookings)}")
if all_bookings:
    logger.debug(f"Earliest booking date: {min(b['check_in'] for b in all_bookings)}")
    logger.debug(f"Latest booking date: {max(b['check_out'] for b in all_bookings)}")

Recommendations

    Collaboration with API Provider: If limitations persist, direct communication with the API service (here, Smoobu) might be invaluable to understand any date constraints or known issues.
    Enhanced Monitoring: Apply scraping or diagnostics for a few weeks to spot trends or repetitious cut-offs in date fetching.

The main takeaway is that there might be an external factor or configuration that could be influencing the perceived cap in data beyond your described November 2024.
